# PixelParticles

This project uses the idea of cellular automata to implement simple simulations for particles such as sand and water, similar to the game Noita or a falling sand game.

## What's Next
- Adding new types of particles
- Implementing particles as vertex buffers and rendering them all in one draw call to improve performance
- Allowing different types of particles to interact with each other
- Adding more physics elements such as velocity and gravity to make the simulation more realistic and to untie simulation speed from frame rate
- Adding an editor to allow users to place particles
